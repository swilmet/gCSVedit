-------------------------

* Create app menu only if the desktop prefers one, to avoid a double menubar on
  e.g. Xfce.
* All problems with the Flatpak packaging are fixed:
	* Revert to using GtkFileChooserDialog. Using GtkFileChooserNative was
	  a bad idea because the GFile that we obtained (in flatpak) didn't
	  have the real path to the file, so it screwed up some features in
	  gCSVedit:
		- showing the directory in parentheses in the window title;
		- opening a recent file.
	* Add --talk-name=org.gtk.vfs.* in the finish-args to be able to load
	  and save GVfs metadata (to remember the DSV delimiter and the column
	  titles line).

News in 0.4.0, 2017-03-18
-------------------------

User-visible changes:
* When hovering a menu item, show a longer description in the statusbar.
* Add a sub-menu to open recently used files, with the full path of the files
  shown in the statusbar.

Under-the-hood changes:
* Use GtkSourceRegion (now a public class of GtkSourceView).
* Create a Flatpak build manifest.
* Use GtkFileChooserNative (required to properly sandbox the application with
  Flatpak).
* Use the new Gtef library. Some general-purpose text editor features of
  gCSVedit have been moved to Gtef.
* Use GtefFileLoader, GtefFileSaver and GtefFileMetadata.
* Create the menu bar with the Gtef API.
* Create the GcsvApplication class.
* Improvements to the build system.

* After successful file loading or saving, add the file to the list of recently

News in 0.0.2, 2016-01-12
-------------------------
* gCSVedit is now a free/libre software (under the GPLv3+ license)
* Real spaces (those present in the file) are drawn with gray symbols
* The CSV column number is shown in the statusbar

  the header is not taken into account for the alignment.

* Add AppData
* Add an app-menu
